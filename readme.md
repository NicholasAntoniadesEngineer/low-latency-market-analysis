# low-latency-market-analysis

a low-latency market data processing system using the de10 nano (cyclone v soc) platform.

## project overview

this project implements a high-performance market data processing system using the de10 nano's dual-core arm cortex-a9 processor and cyclone v fpga. the system is designed to process market data streams, detect trading opportunities, and execute trades with minimal latency.

### key features

- real-time market data processing on fpga fabric
- hardware-accelerated technical indicator calculations
- low-latency order execution system
- integration with alpaca markets api
- websocket-based market data ingestion
- custom linux drivers for fpga communication
- integration of the RFS2 board for wireless communication and networking

### directory structure explanation

- `hps/`: hardware processing system (arm cores) code
  - `core0/`: primary core handling market data ingestion
  - `core1/`: secondary core for strategy execution
  - `common/`: shared libraries and headers
- `fpga/`: fpga fabric implementation
  - `src/hdl/`: verilog/vhdl source files
  - `src/constraints/`: timing and pin constraints
- `docs/`: documentation for both hps and fpga components

### build system

each component has its own build and execution scripts:

#### hps build system
- `core0/scripts/build.sh`: compiles market data handling components
- `core0/scripts/run.sh`: deploys and runs core0 processes
- `core1/scripts/build.sh`: compiles strategy execution components
- `core1/scripts/run.sh`: deploys and runs core1 processes

#### fpga build system
- `fpga/scripts/build.sh`: synthesizes and implements fpga design
- `fpga/scripts/program.sh`: programs the fpga with generated bitstream

## hardware requirements

- terasic de10 nano development board
- ethernet connection
- microsd card (16gb+ recommended)
- usb power supply

## software requirements

- quartus prime lite (free version)
  - compile the fpga design and and programme fpga
- DE10-Nano System Builder  
- linux os (custom built or provided image)
- alpaca markets api account (free paper trading account)
- sdcard flashing tool (etcher)

## system architecture

### fpga components
- market data parser
- order book management
- moving average calculation engine
- momentum indicator processor
- pattern recognition module

### software components
- linux-based control system
- alpaca markets api interface
- configuration and monitoring interface
- trading strategy implementation
- data logging and analysis tools

## development roadmap

### phase 1: basic infrastructure
- linux system setup
- fpga-software communication
- basic market data ingestion

### phase 2: fpga development
- implement market data parser
- develop technical indicator modules
- create order book management system

### phase 3: trading system
- strategy implementation
- risk management
- performance optimization

### phase 4: Integrate the RFS2 board
- implement wireless communication
- add networking capabilities for remote monitoring and control

## testing

the system can be tested using:
- alpaca's paper trading environment
- historical market data replay
- simulated market data generation

## performance metrics

target performance metrics:
- market data processing latency: <1μs
- order execution latency: <10μs
- strategy calculation time: <5μs
